# Optimal-Bowl-Shape
A poorly written short story about the quest for the best bowl that there could be (for minimising the material needed to contain a given volume of liquid). This was originally published on a (now defunct) personal blog. The interesting thing about this proof is that it's calculation free, and doesn't require any advanced mathematics at all!
